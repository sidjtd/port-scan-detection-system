\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 STEPS TO DECIPHERING LOG IN PYTHON\

\b0 \
1. Import Log\
2. Count Log length (remove erroneous lines, to prevent false counts, if any)\
3. Identify all Unique Origin IP Addresses\
4. Identify all Unique Destination IP Addresses\
5. Catalog Information\
Extra: Correlate which Origin addresses are accessing which and how many Destinations addresses\
\
\

\b SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED COURSE OF ACTION\

\b0 \
A number of accesses have been attempted (over 7100).\
\
Out of the total log data, IP Address 
\b 192.168.202.141
\b0  has accessed 2380 destination addresses that we log, which amounts to over 1/3 or 33.32% of all access attempts within the logs time period.\
\
In addition, the following addresses were noted to have disproportionately high levels of access requests\
\
192.168.202.110: 986\
192.168.202.140: 894\
192.168.204.45: 839\
192.168.202.79: 274\
192.168.202.109: 220\
192.168.202.138: 237\
192.168.202.68: 176\
192.168.203.45: 166\
192.168.202.112: 116\
(Subtotal = 3908 Accesses)\
\
In other words, out of all 49 unique origin addresses from the log, the above 10 addresses cover 3908 accesses, which  vombined with the 2380 accesses from 192.168.202.141 alone, the total accesses numbers comes up to 6216, or 87.1% (almost 90%) of the entire 7134 access attempts from only 20% of the origin addresses.\
\
In order to ensure security, control and lockdown these these origin addresses and double check if these addresses are relevant to any of our official business workings so we don\'92t inadvertently block an address that is essential to the smooth workflow of our business. If immediate confirmation is not possible, we may have to block these addresses preemptively to prevent any further unauthorized access.\
\
More analysis is needed on what these accesses were attempting to do.  Additionally, we may want to catalog what resources the destination addresses are pointing to in order to identify what informations may have been compromised or what we can further secure to help our operations.\
